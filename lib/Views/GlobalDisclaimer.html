    I have started to add 3d-objects to the catalog (under 3D-Objects). Many
    3d-objects, also related to leylines and power places are freely available,
    but need quite a lot of disk space on the server (especially high resolution
    textures). Therefore, if you want me to add more 3d objects to the catalog,
    I need more disk space. If you support me I can rent more disk space and
    place more models.
